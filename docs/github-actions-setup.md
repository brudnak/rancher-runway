# GitHub Actions Setup

This repo can run disposable Rancher alpha sign-off lanes in GitHub
Actions while still keeping local `tool-config.yml` usage unchanged.

The GitHub Actions path is intentionally environment-gated:

- `automation-bootstrap` creates or updates the Terraform state backend.
- `rancher-signoff` provisions Rancher, optional Linode downstreams, optional
  direct `rancher/tests` suite runs, writes compact receipts, and cleans up.

Do not put cloud credentials, Rancher tokens, kubeconfigs, or generated `.env`
files in GitHub variables, logs, reports, or artifacts.

## Repository Environments

Create these GitHub environments under repository settings.

| Environment | Purpose | Recommended protection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `automation-bootstrap` | One-time S3/DynamoDB state backend bootstrap. | Required reviewers. |
| `rancher-signoff` | Live AWS/Linode Rancher sign-off lanes. | Required reviewers. |

## Bootstrap Environment

`automation-bootstrap` needs one secret:

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AWS_BOOTSTRAP_ROLE_ARN` | yes | AWS OIDC role that can create/update the S3 state bucket and DynamoDB lock table. |

Run `.github/workflows/bootstrap-terraform-state.yml` first with `apply=false`.
After reviewing the plan, run it again with `apply=true`.

The apply run writes a non-secret `terraform-backend-env` artifact and step
summary:

```bash
TF_STATE_BUCKET=...
TF_STATE_LOCK_TABLE=...
TF_STATE_REGION=...
```

Copy those values into `rancher-signoff` environment variables. Bucket and
table names are not credentials, but they are visible to anyone who can view
workflow logs/artifacts for this repository.

## Sign-Off Environment Secrets

`rancher-signoff` secrets:

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AWS_AUTOMATION_ROLE_ARN` | yes | AWS OIDC role used by live sign-off lanes. |
| `RANCHER_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` | yes | Initial Rancher admin password rendered into generated `tool-config.yml`. |
| `LINODE_TOKEN` | yes for downstream lanes | Linode token used by Rancher to create the disposable downstream K3s node. |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | optional | Docker Hub auth for RKE2 pulls when needed. |
| `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD` | optional | Docker Hub auth for RKE2 pulls when needed. |
The workflow masks repository secrets, generated Rancher admin tokens, and the
generated Linode root password before noisy provisioning steps.

## Sign-Off Environment Variables

`rancher-signoff` variables:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TF_STATE_BUCKET` | yes | S3 bucket from bootstrap output. |
| `TF_STATE_LOCK_TABLE` | yes | DynamoDB lock table from bootstrap output. |
| `TF_STATE_REGION` | yes | AWS region for the Terraform backend. |
| `AWS_REGION` | yes | AWS region for Rancher infrastructure. |
| `AWS_VPC` | yes | Existing VPC ID. |
| `AWS_SUBNET_A` | yes | Existing subnet for HA node/security wiring. |
| `AWS_SUBNET_B` | yes | Existing subnet for HA node/security wiring. |
| `AWS_SUBNET_C` | yes | Existing subnet for HA node/security wiring. |
| `AWS_AMI` | yes | AMI used by Rancher HA nodes. |
| `AWS_SUBNET_ID` | yes | Subnet ID used by EC2 instances. |
| `AWS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID` | yes | Security group ID used by EC2 instances. |
| `AWS_PEM_KEY_NAME` | yes | Existing EC2 key pair name expected by the Terraform module. |
| `AWS_ROUTE53_FQDN` | yes | Route53 zone/domain suffix used for Rancher DNS records. |
| `AWS_PREFIX` | recommended | Owner/base prefix included in generated sign-off resource names, for example `atb` produces `gha-atb-23456789-wu`. |
| `OWNER_FIRST_NAME` | yes | First name used in AWS `Owner` tags. |
| `OWNER_LAST_NAME` | yes | Last name used in AWS `Owner` tags. |
| `RANCHER_TESTS_REF` | optional | Ref to clone from `https://github.com/rancher/tests.git`; defaults to `main`. |
| `RANCHER_TEST_SUITE_SETTLE_SECONDS` | optional | Pause between direct `rancher/tests` suites; defaults to `30`. |

## Workflows

| Workflow | Creates cloud resources | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signoff-plan.yml` | no, but it can dispatch the runner | Manual plan generation from `signoff-targets.json` or a single input version. Dispatch skips lanes already active or already successful on the current branch unless `rerun_successful_lanes=true`. |
| `bootstrap-terraform-state.yml` | yes, only when `apply=true` | Creates or updates the persistent S3/DynamoDB backend. |
| `run-rancher-signoff-lane.yml` | yes | Runs one Rancher sign-off lane, optionally with Linode downstreams and direct `rancher/tests` suite runs, then cleans up. |

## First Live Run

After environments, secrets, and variables are configured:

1. Run `Plan Rancher Sign-Off` manually for a known alpha, for example
   `v2.13.5-alpha5`, with `dispatch_runs=false`.
2. Run `Run Rancher Sign-Off Lane` with:
   - `rancher_version`: `v2.13.5-alpha5`
   - `lane`: `framework-regression`
   - `keep_infra_on_failure`: `false`
   - `run_rancher_tests`: `false`
3. Confirm the run provisions Rancher, waits for readiness, renders a report,
   uploads a compact JSON receipt, and destroys AWS infrastructure.
4. Next, run `webhook-fresh-install` with `run_rancher_tests=false` to prove the
   single-node Linode downstream and downstream cleanup.
5. After those are clean, enable `run_rancher_tests=true` to clone
   `https://github.com/rancher/tests.git` and run the lane's suites in the same
   workflow job. The `framework-regression` lane runs framework regression plus VAI
   disabled for Rancher 2.11 and older and VAI enabled for Rancher 2.12 and
   newer. Downstream webhook lanes run webhook security settings for Rancher
   2.14 and newer when the actual Rancher chart should contain those settings.
6. For normal use, edit `signoff-targets.json` with the alpha versions you care
   about and run `Plan Rancher Sign-Off` manually with `dispatch_runs=true`.

## Target Selection

Use `signoff-targets.json` as the source of truth for manually selected targets:

```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "rancher_version": "v2.14.1-alpha7"
    }
  ]
}
```

To keep a target in the file without planning it, set `enabled` to `false`.

Use `keep_infra_on_failure=true` only for manual debugging. It can leave AWS and
Linode resources running.

## Safe Artifacts

The sign-off workflow uploads one compact JSON receipt per lane. The receipt
keeps operational recovery fields such as `terraform_state_key` and `aws_prefix`
but omits live Rancher URLs, kubeconfigs, generated environment files, raw
Terraform outputs, and copied logs.

It does not upload:

- generated suite `.env` files
- Rancher admin tokens
- kubeconfigs
- Terraform state files
- AWS credentials
- Linode tokens

## Cleanup

Normal sign-off runs clean up automatically when `keep_infra_on_failure=false`.
